This repo is friendly for first timers and other contributors. I would like to appreciate your effort and contribution. 

This application is made with the help of HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Jquery, and Riot js.

This guide may help first timers about what to do other than change the code.

The design of the application is fairly simple so that even the non-tech users can understand it. However if you feel that it is complex to understand, let me know. We can simplify it.

For the development purpose, 

There are 2 kinds of files
- Files ending with `.tag` extensions 
- and other

Don't do the change in `tags\tags.js`. If you change anything in files ending with `.tag` extensions. You'll have to follow following steps;

1. clone the repo in your local
2. Run `npm install`. It'll install **riot** npm package on your machine.
3. Run `npm run compile` command. It'll generate `tags\tags.js`.

Don't hesitate to clear your doubts.

If you like this application, don't forget to share with your friends and [star](https://github.com/funcards/match-it/stargazers) it.
