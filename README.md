Randomly rotated, and resized images can introduce extra level of complexity.

You can also design the game for similar match instead of exact match. Eg in below cards, players need to match the image belonging to the same group.

## Design guide

This section may helpful to design good games.

- Kids like colors. So avoid black & white text or images.
- Avoid gradient, or shaded colors.
- You can increase complexity with rotated, similar color, similar looking, and different size images.
- Avoid rectangle images or images with border.
- Images with transparent background are good.
